So …

This is new.

I’m not really sure what this is gonna be. I’ll probably change my mind a lot about what I’m gonna put on here but it’ll be mostly game development and nerdish stuff.

It’ll start with following me as begin my journey of writing a full game/app a week for 8 weeks over the summer spanning me from when I leave college and start uni. This will have everything from brainstorming ideas to getting them on the google play store. The code won’t be pretty but it’ll work.

I might also write about events that I go to  i.e. gaming festivals.

One thing is for sure this is gonna be the worst blog ever so enjoy!
