I'll start by saying I've never been good at art but allways have loved coding little unfinished games . I allways let my lack of both artistic talent and money to buy assets stop me from finishing the games I code . 

Enough is Enough ! 

This time I thought I'd take the oppotunity to try and learn how to 3D model . 

I started off simple with a low poly square island . I couldn't figure out how to render the model in maya so I decided that the best way to view it would be in unity the 3d game engine . I thought itd be nice to have a reflection in the water but I didnt want to waste time coding it , so instead i just fliped the modle upsidedown and put it under the water which was just a slightly seethrough plane.

This looked crap partially because it was in unity and i didnt litght it atall but mainly because I couldn't 3d model ,but I wasnt gonna let that stop me !

Next I thought I'd try and make something that I remember seeing on the <a href="www.reddit.com/r/lowpoly">/r/LowPoly</a> subreddit a few months back . It had trees flowers a bridge and a stream down the middle I thought I'd give it a go . Lo and behold It turned out Ok (to be honest it is alot better than I thought it was gonna be.

This gave me some confidence to try something a bit more ambitious so I added a bridge to the side of this island and connected it to another which had this strange building on it . I saw something very similar to this building in a low poly timelapse on youtube Ill link it here if I can find it next week .

This doesn't look good by any stretch of the imagination but it was good enough . This spurred me to turn this into a super monkey ball style game .

I havent got very far with it atall as I did all of this just before exam season started but I like the way it looks and will make this my first finished game I'll put it somewhere like <a href="www.itch.io">itch.io</a> or something when I finish it. 

This has been my first Dive into 3D modeling and I've enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I'll make sure to make more post's like this as and when I make some progress in my ability's.
